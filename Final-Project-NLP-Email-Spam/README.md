# Email Spam ML Model Predictions using NLP

The featured Jupyter Notebook showcases my capstone project for the Break Through Tech AI Machine Learning Foundations course.

## Description

With the Enron spam data set, I will be predicting whether an email is spam or not based on its subject line/body content (essentially an email's similarity to previous emails classified as spam). Since the data set has a given label, I will be solving a supervised learning problem, as I am not guessing what label to predict. The unique values in the label category are 0 or 1, meaning I will also be solving a binary classification problem. Lastly, email spam is an occurrence many people may come across in their daily lives. Oftentimes, these spam emails may reach unsuspecting employees at companies of all sizes, seeking to exploit such vulnerabilities to potentially corrupt company devices or the company system or to extract confidential information. In addition, manually deleting spam emails could lead to decreased productivity due to spending time deleting emails and not working, and it could also lead to deleting important emails if not read carefully. While spam filters do exist, malicious attackers are constantly updating and adapting to any cybersecurity efforts, so it is necessary to also update and adapt to their current and existing schemes through using past data. However, it is also essential to be able to predict how threat actors may attempt to exploit others in the future before they are able to even become a threat.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* It may be necessary to install Jupyter Notebooks but is not necessary for viewing the notebook (without execution). Instructions can be found here: https://jupyter.org/install.

### Executing program

* If Jupyter Notebooks is installed, the program can be executed simply by pressing the 'Run' button (looks like a triangle on the toolbar).
